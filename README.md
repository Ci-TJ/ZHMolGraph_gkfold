# ZHMolGraph

AI-Bind is a deep-learning  pipeline that provides interpretable binding predictions for never-before-seen proteins and ligands. AI-Bind is capable of rapid screening of large chemical libraries and guiding computationally expensive auto-docking simulations by prioritizing protein-ligand pairs for validation. The pipeline requires as input simple chemical features such as the amino-acid sequence of a protein and the isomeric SMILE of a ligand, which helps to overcome limitations associated with the lack of available 3D protein structures.
